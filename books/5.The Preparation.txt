All his four heroic princes now with Dasa-ratha stayed 
In Mithila’s ancient city, and their father’s will obeyed, 
Thither came the bold Yudhajit prince of proud Kaikeya’s line, 
On the day that Dasa-ratha made his gifts of gold and kine, 
And he met the ancient monarch, for his health and safety prayed, 
Made his bow and due obeisance and in gentle accents said:
“List, O king! my royal father, monarch of Kaikeya’s race, 
Sends his kindly love and greetings with his blessings and his grace,
 
[11] And he asks if Dasa-ratha prospers in his wonted health, 
If his friends and fond relations live in happiness and wealth.
Queen Kaikeyi is my sister, and to see her son I came, 
Bharat prince of peerless virtue, worthy of his father’s fame,
Aye, to see that youth of valour, by my royal father sent, 
To Ayodhya’s ancient city with an anxious heart I went,
In the city of Mithila, – thus did all thy subjects say, –
With his sons and with his kinsmen Dasa-ratha makes his stay, 
Hence in haste I journeyed hither, travelling late and early dawn,
For to do thee due obeisance and to greet my sister’s son!”
Spake the young and proud Kaikeya, dear and duly-greeted guest, 
Dasa-ratha on his brother choicest gifts and honours pressed.
Brightly dawned the happy morning, and Kosala’s king of fame 
With his sons and wise Vasishtha to the sacred yajna came, 
Rama and his gallant brothers decked in gem and jewel bright, 
In th’ auspicious hour of morning did the blest Kautuka rite,
And beside their royal father piously the princes stood, 
And to fair Videha’s monarch spake Vasishtha wise and good: 
“Dasa-ratha waits expectant with each proud and princely son,
Waits upon the bounteous giver, for each holy rite is done, 
’Twixt the giver and the taker sacred word is sacred deed, 
Seal with gift thy plighted promise, let the nuptial rites proceed!”
Thus the righteous-souled Vasishtha to Videha’s monarch prayed, 
Janak versed in holy Vedas thus in courteous accents said:
“Wherefore waits the king expectant? Free to him this royal dome, 
Since my kingdom is his empire and my palace is his home, 
And the maidens, flame-resplendent, done each fond Kautuka rite, 
Beaming in their bridal beauty tread the sacrificial site!
[12] I beside the lighted altar wait upon thy sacred hest,
And auspicious is the moment, sage Vasishtha knows the rest,
Let the peerless Dasa-ratha, proud Kosala’s king of might, 
With his sons and honoured sages enter on the holy site,
Let the righteous sage Vasishtha, sprung from Vedic saints of old,
Celebrate the happy wedding; be the sacred mantras told!”
