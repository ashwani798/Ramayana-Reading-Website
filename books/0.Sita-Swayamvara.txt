Ramayana, Epic of Rama, Prince of India 

Book I. Sita-Swayamvara 

(The Bridal of Sita)

 
[1] The Epic relates to the ancient traditions of two powerful races, the Kosalas 
and the Videhas, who lived in Northern India between the twelfth and tenth 
centuries before Christ. The names Kosala and Videha in the singular number 
indicate the kingdoms, – Oudh and North Behar, – and in the plural number they 
mean the ancient races which inhabited those two countries. 
According to the Epic, Dasa-ratha king of the Kosalas had four sons, the eldest 
of whom was Rama the hero of the poem. And Janak king of the Videhas had a 
daughter named Sita, who was miraculously born of a field furrow, and who is 
the heroine of the Epic. 
Janak ordained a severe test for the hand of his daughter, and many a prince and 
warrior came and went away disappointed. Rama succeeded, and won Sita. The 
story of Rama’s winning his bride, and of the marriage of his three brothers with 
the sister and cousins of Sita, forms the subject of this Book.
